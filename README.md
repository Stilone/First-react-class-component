Two years ago, creating detailed README files wasn't a priority for me, as evidenced by the preceding text. During that period, my main emphasis was on improving my skills and exploring new territories in the realm of coding. Although I didn't fully comprehend the significance at the time, refining my abilities and broadening my skill set took precedence. Now, as I revisit and edit each file, I find satisfaction in observing tangible results. Over the years, I've developed an appreciation for tracking the evolution of my coding style, the strategies I employ, and even the ongoing challenge of naming variables and components 😄.

**Project Description:**
This project originated as a test assignment, and it's no surprise why I wasn't selected for the internship. I mistakenly believed that well-written and functional code was the only indicator of success. However, I've learned that design is equally crucial, as it reflects your problem-solving approach.

**React on Classes:**
This project marks my first foray into writing React components using class syntax. It stands as a milestone in my journey of mastering React.

**Technology Stack:**
- React (Class Components) 🚀
- redux 🔄
- redux-thunk ⚙️
- Material-UI 💅
- API Star Wars 🌐
