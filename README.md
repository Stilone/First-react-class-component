In the world of code, understanding where we came from is crucial to shaping where we are headed. The following text is a reflection on my journey, a snapshot of growth and evolution.

Two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to crafting README files. The text above stands as evidence. Back then, honing my skills and advancing to new horizons was my primary focus. I didn't know why, but at that time, refining my abilities and expanding my skill set took precedence. Now, I sit and edit each file, enjoying the results. Over time, I've come to appreciate witnessing the evolution of my code style, the approaches I use, and even the struggle with naming variables and components 😄.

**Project Description:**
This project originated as a test assignment, and it's no surprise why I wasn't selected for the internship. I mistakenly believed that well-written and functional code was the only indicator of success. However, I've learned that design is equally crucial, as it reflects your problem-solving approach.

**React on Classes:**
This project marks my first foray into writing React components using class syntax. It stands as a milestone in my journey of mastering React.

**Technology Stack:**
- React (Class Components) 🚀
- redux 🔄
- redux-thunk ⚙️
- Material-UI 💅
- API Star Wars 🌐
